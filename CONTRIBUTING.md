## About this project 

The Department for Education produces over 70 statistics series every year, with data being used by the general public, schools and local authorities, the media and central government amongst others. These are used to improve the transparency of the education system and shine a light on education policy and delivery.

The solution is built around two main applications, a public facing service and an internal facing administrative application along with several smaller micro-services. The architecture is designed to consist of loosely coupled task specific components covering a small area of the application with communication between components handled by message queues and REST APIs.
