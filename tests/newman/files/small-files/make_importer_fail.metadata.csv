"Release of underlying data for national curriculum assessments at key stage 2 in England, 2019 ",,,,
,,,,
Background,,,,
,,,,
"This statistical publication provides provisional 2019 key stage 2 national curriculum assessment results for pupils in schools in England at national, regional and local authority level. ",,,,
It extends and updates the interim figures released in July 2019.,,,,
Information on attainment and average scaled scores has also been broken down by the following pupil characteristics:,,,,
* gender,,,,
* ethnicity,,,,
* English as a first language,,,,
* free school meal eligibility,,,,
* disadvantage,,,,
* special educational need,,,,
* month of birth,,,,
,,,,
"A methodology document accompanies this publication. This document provides further information on the data sources, their coverage, the quality and how the data is validated and processed.",,,,
,,,,
,,,,
Coverage,,,,
,,,,
The figures reported in this release for national curriculum tests are based upon those papers that were returned by schools for marking to the STA.,,,,
,,,,
National figures,,,,
,,,,
"National figures cover all schools in England with pupils eligible for assessment at key stage 2 in 2019. As participation by independent schools is voluntary, the national data only include results from those independent schools which chose to make a return.",,,,
Any pupils who do not have a valid outcome for a subject are excluded from the calculations for that subject and do not appear in the number of eligible pupils or in the outcome percentages for that subject.,,,,
"Valid outcomes for the national figures for tests are: achieved the expected standard (AS), not achieved the expected standard (NS), special consideration (CA), working below the standard of the test (B), absent (A), maladministration (Q) or ‘unable to access the test’ (T). ",,,,
Valid outcomes for the national figures for teacher assessments differ by subject.,,,,
"For writing, they are: working at greater depth within the expected standard (GDS), achieved the expected standard (EXS), working towards the expected standard (WTS), Pre-key stage standards (1-6), working below the standard of the pre-key stage (BLW), absent (A), disapplied from the national curriculum (D) and maladministration (Q).",,,,
"For science, they are: EXS, HNM, A, D and Q.",,,,
,,,,
"Local authority, local authority district and parliamentary constituency figures",,,,
,,,,
"Local authority (LA), local authority district (LAD) and parliamentary constituency figures cover state-funded schools in England, including academies, free schools and state-funded special schools. ",,,,
Independent schools and alternative provision are excluded. ,,,,
"Pupils with ‘pending maladministration’ (S), ‘missing’ (M) and ‘pupil took the test/was assessed in a previous year’ (P) are also included. Pupils with P would have the P replaced with their previous result if it can be found – those left with P will be only those for which no previous result could be found.",,,,

,,,,
Variable definitions,,,,
,,,,
The percentage of pupils achieving each indicator is calculated by taking the number of pupils achieving that particular indicator divided by the relevant denominator and multiplying by 100.  ,,,,
"For example, to calculate the percentage of girls achieving the expected standard in reading test at key stage 2, the calculation would be as follows:",,,,
KS2_READ_TEST_EXP_GIRLS_2019/KS2_READ_TEST_ELIG_GIRLS_2019 * 100,,,,

version,,,-,The version of the data being presented. Provisional results are published in September and are subject to review following the September checking exercise. Revised results are published in December and include characteristics data and progress data. Final results are published in Spring and reflect changes made during the errata process.
school_characteristic,-,"Different types of schools can be aggregated in different ways, according to accountability. The most important aggregations for primary statistics are 'AllSchools', 'AllStateFundedSchools', and 'AllStateFundedMainstreamSchools'. ",,
,,,,
"The 'All schools' figure shows statistics for all schools, giving a broad picture of education landscape in England showing all schools available. ",,,,
,,,,
"The 'AllStateFundedSchools' figures show statistics for schools that are funded by the state and are therefore accountable. This aggregation includes LA-maintained schools and academies, as well as special schools. Alternative provision schools, independent schools and MOD schools are excluded. These schools are held to account because they receive government funding. Independent schools do not have to submit test results or census returns. ",,,,

,,,,"This aggregation includes LA-maintained schools and academies. Special schools, alternative provision schools, independent schools and MOD schools are excluded. These are the schools that we hold to account in our measures."
 ,,,,
source_methodology,-,Local authority-level statistics can be calculated based on three methodologies: (1) 'ResponsibleLA' shows results for schools that are accountable to that local authority. This is the default methodology reported in the primary statistics as it shows results for which the local authority is accountable. (2) 'PupilResidency' shows results for pupils that are resident within the geographic boundaries of that local authority. These pupils will usually also attend school in that local authority but in some cases may attend a school in another local authority. (3) 'SchoolLocation' shows results for schools that sit within the geographic boundaries of the local authority. In most cases these schools will also be accountable to that local authority but in some cases a school may be accountable to a different local authority. ,,

school_characteristic,-,"Different types of schools can be aggregated in different ways, according to accountability. The most important aggregations for primary statistics are 'AllSchools', 'AllStateFundedSchools', and 'AllStateFundedMainstreamSchools'. ",,
,,,,
"The 'All schools' figure shows statistics for all schools, giving a broad picture of education landscape in England showing all schools available. ",,,,
,,,,
"The 'AllStateFundedSchools' figures show statistics for schools that are funded by the state and are therefore accountable. This aggregation includes LA-maintained schools and academies, as well as special schools. Alternative provision schools, independent schools and MOD schools are excluded. These schools are held to account because they receive government funding. Independent schools do not have to submit test results or census returns. ",,,,

The 'AllStateFundedMainstreamSchools' figures show statistics for schools that are funded by the state and are therefore accountable. ,,,,
,,,,"This aggregation includes LA-maintained schools and academies. Special schools, alternative provision schools, independent schools and MOD schools are excluded. These are the schools that we hold to account in our measures."

source_methodology,-,Local authority-level statistics can be calculated based on three methodologies: (1) 'ResponsibleLA' shows results for schools that are accountable to that local authority. This is the default methodology reported in the primary statistics as it shows results for which the local authority is accountable. (2) 'PupilResidency' shows results for pupils that are resident within the geographic boundaries of that local authority. These pupils will usually also attend school in that local authority but in some cases may attend a school in another local authority. (3) 'SchoolLocation' shows results for schools that sit within the geographic boundaries of the local authority. In most cases these schools will also be accountable to that local authority but in some cases a school may be accountable to a different local authority. ,,
breakdown,,-,Primary statistics are reported with many breakdowns according to characteristics of schools and pupils. This variable provides a flag to identify which breakdown of the data is being shown in a row.,
