*** Comments ***
#
# This test suite tests the keywords that form the basis of our seed data generation mechanism. Keeping these
# keywords in regular test runs prevents them from becoming stale over time in between them being used to
# seed / reseed environments.
#
# Because these tests set up data under the standard Test Topic set up for each unique test run, they will be
# torn down again afterwards.
