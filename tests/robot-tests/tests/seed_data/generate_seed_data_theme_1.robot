# This test suite is responsible for setting up various Publications and Releases for the use of various Robot test
# suites, particularly those used in the general public testing, where we are more reliant on standing seed data rather
# than being free to generate new data for restricted environments.

#
# When seeding data for an environment, you will need to use the `--reseed` option of the `run_tests.py` script.
