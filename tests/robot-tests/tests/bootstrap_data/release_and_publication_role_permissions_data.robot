# This test suite is responsible for setting up various Publications and Releases for the use of the Publication
# and Release Permissions UI tests.
#
# Releases are created in each approval state and a different role is assigned to Analyst1 for each.    This way,
# there is a unique Release for each combination of Release approval status available and Release / Publication role.
