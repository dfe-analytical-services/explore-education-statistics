# The more complex "EDITABLE_ACCORDION" selectors below are necessary to target controls that lie outside of the
# accordion section itself e.g. the "Add new section" button.    These are necessary to use to differentiate
# between different "Add new section" buttons (as an example) when more than one set of content accordions appears
# on the page, for instance with Methodologies where Content and Annex areas are available.
