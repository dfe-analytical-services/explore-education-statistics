    # A problem would occur if a user was able to click the "Save & close" button in the time between us
    # losing focus from the text block (which triggers the delayed onBlur()) and the user clicking the
    # "Save & close" button.    If they were able to do that within the 100ms delay between the focus leaving the
    # text block and the delayed onBlur() occurring, it would leave the page saying "1 content block has
    # unsaved changes" and with an internal state that indicates we still have dirty text blocks, despite
    # actually not having any unsaved changes.
    #
    # Given this, we wait for 500ms in order to give the onBlur() a chance to execute.
