#In local, public url contains authentication details. In order to make it work while running against dev- we need to get rid of it to compare public url against expected value.

*** Test Cases ***

Parse and Store public url without auth details
    ${PUBLIC_URL_WITHOUT_AUTH}=    remove auth from url    %{PUBLIC_URL}
    set suite variable    ${PUBLIC_URL_WITHOUT_AUTH}

Verify that absolute paths with trailing slashes are redirected without them
    user navigates to public frontend    %{PUBLIC_URL}/data-catalogue/
    user waits until page contains    Data catalogue
    user checks url without auth equals   ${PUBLIC_URL_WITHOUT_AUTH}/data-catalogue

    user navigates to public frontend    %{PUBLIC_URL}/data-catalogue
    user waits until page contains    Data catalogue
    user checks url without auth equals   ${PUBLIC_URL_WITHOUT_AUTH}/data-catalogue

    user navigates to public frontend    %{PUBLIC_URL}/glossary/?someRandomUrlParameter=123
    user waits until page contains    Glossary
    user checks url without auth equals    ${PUBLIC_URL_WITHOUT_AUTH}/glossary?someRandomUrlParameter=123

    # Would be amazing if we could verify these redirects were done with a 301 rather than a 308...

Verify that redirects do not affect browser history
    user navigates to    about:blank

    user navigates to public frontend    %{PUBLIC_URL}/data-catalogue/
    user waits until page contains    Data catalogue
    user checks url without auth equals   ${PUBLIC_URL_WITHOUT_AUTH}/data-catalogue

    user goes back
    user checks url equals    about:blank

Verify that routes without an absolute path still permit trailing slashes
    user navigates to public frontend    %{PUBLIC_URL}/
    user waits until page contains    Explore education statistics
    user checks url equals    %{PUBLIC_URL}/

    user navigates to public frontend    %{PUBLIC_URL}

    user navigates to public frontend    %{PUBLIC_URL}/data-catalogue/1000
    user waits until page contains    Data catalogue
    user checks url without auth equals    ${PUBLIC_URL_WITHOUT_AUTH}/data-catalogue

Verify that routes with search parameters retain them
    user navigates to public frontend    %{PUBLIC_URL}/data-catalogue?foo=bar&baz=zod
    user waits until page contains    Data catalogue
    user checks url without auth equals    ${PUBLIC_URL_WITHOUT_AUTH}/data-catalogue
