      Ad hoc official statistics are one off publications that have been
      produced as far as possible in line with the Code of Practice for
      Statistics.
    </p>
    <p>This can be broadly interpreted to mean that these statistics are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>managed impartially and objectively in the public interest</li>

      <li>meet identified user needs</li>

      <li>produced according to sound methods</li>

      <li>well explained and readily accessible</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
