                    2022. The ILR is an administrative data collection system

                    training providers for learners in FE and on apprenticeship

                    , due to Coronavirus (COVID-19), we have not published
                    institution-level qualification achievement rates (QARs) in

                    The furlough scheme may also have impacted on how aspects of
                    ILR data were recorded, such as how the ‘learning status’ of
                    a learner was captured, e.g. whether a learner was recorded
                    as a continuing learner or whether they were recorded as
                    being on a break in learning while still being with an
                    employer.
