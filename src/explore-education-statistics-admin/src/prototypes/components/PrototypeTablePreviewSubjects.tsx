            Local authority level data on care leavers aged 17 to 21, by
            accommodation type (as measured on or around their birthday).
          </p>
          <p>Footnotes:</p>
          <p>
            1. National and regional numbers have been rounded to the nearest
            10. Percentages rounded to the nearest whole number. Figures exclude
            young people who were looked after under an agreed series of short
            term placements, those who have died since leaving care, those who
            have returned home to parents or someone with parental
            responsibility for a continuous period of at least 6 months and
            those whose care was transferred to another local authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. 'Local authority not in touch' excludes young people where
            activity information is known, as a third party provided it even
            though the local authority is not directly in touch with the young
            person.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Accommodated with parents or relatives is likely to be an under
            count - if a young person's former foster carer is a relative they
            should be recorded as accommodated with their former foster carer.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. For some local authorities, such as Kent, the figures may be
            impacted by significant numbers of unaccompanied asylum seeking
            children.
