const headlines = `In total there were 26,955 new entrants to ITT in 2023/24 compared to 28,463 in 2022/23 [1], 36,159 in 2021/22 and 40,377 in 2020/21.  
In 2020/21, we saw an unprecedented increase in new entrants to ITT, which was likely to be a direct result of the impact of COVID-19, and these higher levels 
continued, to a lesser extent, into 2021/22. In 2022/23 and 2023/24, numbers have been below pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Of the new entrants in 2023/24, 21,946 were starting postgraduate ITT, a decrease (3%) from 22,673 in 2022/23. 
There were 5,009 new entrants to undergraduate ITT in 2023/24, a decrease (13%) from 5,790 in 2022/23.</p>
<p>The percentage of the Postgraduate Initial Teacher Training (PGITT) target achieved for all subjects (secondary and primary) was 62%. 
This is a decrease of 8 percentage points from 70% in 2022/23. This was driven by a decrease in the number of new entrants to PGITT (of 727) 
and an increase in the target (from 32,600 in 2022/23 to 35,540 in 2023/24).`;

data collected in the HESA (Higher Education Statistics Agency) ITT collection. Please see methodology for further detail. &nbsp;</p><p>This year the

courses, for courses that start in the years 2022/23 and 2023/24. These statistics are classified as official statistics in development, which is a 
temporary label for new statistics that are undergoing development and testing. More information can be found under Background to end of application cycle
