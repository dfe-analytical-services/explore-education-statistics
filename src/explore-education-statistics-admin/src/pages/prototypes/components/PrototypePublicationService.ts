Information on absence in pupil referral units, and for pupils aged four, is also included. The Department uses two key measures to monitor pupil absence â€“ overall and persistent absence. Absence by reason and pupils characteristics is also included in this release. Figures are available at national, regional, local authority and school level. Figures held in this release are used for policy development as key indicators in behaviour and school attendance policy. Schools and local authorities also use the statistics to compare their local absence rates to regional and national averages for different pupil groups.',

                'The overall absence rate across state-funded primary, secondary and special schools increased from 4.6 per cent in 2015/16 to 4.7 per cent in 2016/17. In primary schools the overall absence rate stayed the same at 4 per cent and the rate in secondary schools increased from 5.2 per cent to 5.4 per cent. Absence in special schools is much higher at 9.7 per cent in 2016/17\n\nThe increase in overall absence rate has been driven by an increase in the unauthorised absence rate across state-funded primary, secondary and special schools - which increased from 1.1 per cent to 1.3 per cent between 2015/16 and 2016/17.\n\nLooking at longer-term trends, overall and authorised absence rates have been fairly stable over recent years after decreasing gradually between 2006/07 and 2013/14. Unauthorised absence rates have not varied much since 2006/07, however the unauthorised absence rate is now at its highest since records began, at 1.3 per cent.\n\nThis increase in unauthorised absence is due to an increase in absence due to family holidays that were not agreed by the school. The authorised absence rate has not changed since last year, at 3.4 per cent. Though in primary schools authorised absence rates have been decreasing across recent years.\n\nThe total number of days missed due to overall absence across state-funded primary, secondary and special schools has increased since last year, from 54.8 million in 2015/16 to 56.7 million in 2016/17. This partly reflects the rise in the total number of pupil enrolments, the average number of days missed per enrolment has increased very slightly from 8.1 days in 2015/16 to 8.2 days in 2016/17.\n\nIn 2016/17, 91.8 per cent of pupils in state-funded primary, state-funded secondary and special schools missed at least one session during the school year, this is similar to the previous year (91.7 per cent in 2015/16).',

Longer term, there has been a decrease in the proportion of absence that persistent absentees account for â€“ down from 43.3 per cent in 2011/12.\n\nThe overall absence rate for persistent absentees across all schools was 18.1 per cent, nearly four times higher than the rate for all pupils. This is a slight increase from 2015/16, when the overall absence rate for persistent absentees was 17.6 per cent.\n\nPersistent absentees account for almost a third, 31.6 per cent, of all authorised absence and more than half, 53.8 per cent of all unauthorised absence.

The persistent absence rates were also similar, at 10.9 per cent for boys and 10.6 per cent for girls.\n\n### Free school meals (FSM) eligibility\n\nAbsence rates are higher for pupils who are known to be eligible for and claiming free school meals. The overall absence rate for these pupils was 7.3 per cent, compared to 4.2 per cent for non FSM pupils. The persistent absence rate for pupils who were eligible for FSM was more than twice the rate for those pupils not eligible for FSM.\n\n### National curriculum year group\n\nPupils in national curriculum year groups 3 and 4 had the lowest overall absence rates at 3.9 and 4 per cent respectively. Pupils in national curriculum year groups 10 and 11 had the highest overall absence rate at 6.1 per cent and 6.2 per cent respectively. This trend is repeated for persistent absence.\n\n### Special educational need (SEN)\n\nPupils with a statement of special educational needs (SEN) or education healthcare plan (EHC) had an overall absence rate of 8.2 per cent compared to 4.3 per cent for those with no identified SEN. The percentage of pupils with a statement of SEN or an EHC plan that are persistent absentees was more than two times higher than the percentage for pupils with no identified SEN.\n\n### Ethnic group\n\nThe highest overall absence rates were for Traveller of Irish Heritage and Gypsy/ Roma pupils at 18.1 per cent and 12.9 per cent respectively. Overall absence rates for pupils of a Chinese and Black African ethnicity were substantially lower than the national average of 4.7 per cent at 2.4 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
