              <p>
                When we talk about content design we mean taking information and
                presenting it to people in the best possible way for their needs
                and requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Good content design allows people to simply and quickly do or
                find what they need from a web page or online service.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the Explore education statistics service, this means helping
                people to simply and quickly carry out the following tasks:
              </p>
              <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>finding and viewing statistics</li>
                <li>downloading data files for offline analysis</li>
                <li>building tables using the table tool</li>
                <li>
                  finding out about the methodology used in collecting and
                  presenting statistics and data
                </li>
                <li>
                  finding out who to contact to ask questions about statistics
                  and data
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Government has a tendency to publish content which is more
                focused on what it wants to say than what people want and need
                to know.
              </p>
              <p>
                This often makes our information difficult to understand and act
                on. This in turn leads to frustrated users who cannot find what
                they need or complete the tasks they want to do.

                From our research, we know people find it difficult to find

                There’s more than one way to present content to people and the
                decisions about how we present it have to be carefully made.
              </p>
              <p>
                Writing content clearly, in plain English and optimised for the
                web helps people understand and find the information they need
                quickly and easily.

                This means all the content design guidance, standards and tips
                in our content-related guides are based on sound and well-known

              <p>
                People read web pages differently to how they read pages in
                print. This means creating good web content is different to
                writing good print content.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our content design guidance is based on our understanding of how
                people read and use DfE content, statistics and data, formed
                from the many hours of user research which we’ve performed (and

                Do not add all the information and content you can to a release.
                Instead, only include what your audience needs to know to
                complete their chosen task. Nothing more.
              </p>
              <p>
                People do not usually read content unless they want information.
                So when you come to creating content, start with the same
                question every time: what do people want to know?

              </ul>
              <p>
                We know this helps people find what they need quickly and easily

              <p>
                Government often explains that because they’re creating
                technical or complex content for a specialist audience, they do
                not need to use plain English.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is not the case as research shows that, in fact,
                specialists prefer simple content written in plain English
                because it allows them to understand the information as quickly
                as possible.
              </p>
              <p>For example, research into legal documents found:</p>
              <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>
                  80% of people preferred sentences written in clear English -
                  and the more complex the issue, the greater that preference
                  (for example, 97% preferred ‘among other things’ over the
                  Latin ‘inter alia’)
                </li>
                <li>
                  the more educated the person and the more specialist their
                  knowledge, the greater their preference for plain English
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                People understand complex specialist language but do not want to
                read it if there’s an alternative. This is because specialists
                and people with the highest literacy levels and the greatest
                expertise tend to have the most to read. They do not have time
                to read through pages of complicated content.

              <h3 id="plain-english">Plain English</h3>
              <p>
                This does not mean you cannot use technical terms in your
                content. It just means you need to explain what they mean the
                first time you use them.

                Our audience is potentially anyone living in the UK who needs to

              </p>
              <p>
                This means we must try to write and communicate in a way that
                most people understand.
              </p>
              <p>
                We know from our own and similar ONS research, very few people
                read to the end of our releases and only around 20% read past
                the first quarter.
              </p>

                With an average page length of 17 pages, with nearly 30% more
                than 20 pages in length and 10% longer than 50 pages, of the
                60-plus publications we currently produce, the majority of them
                go unread and unused.
              </p>
              <p>This is because they are:</p>
              <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

              </ul>
              <p>
                However, now that we know this, we’ve developed a service and
                set of content standards which will help tackle all these
                issues.

                If you can do this then it means you won’t be wasting their time

              </p>
              <p>
                The best way to do this is by using common words and working
                with natural reading behaviour.
              </p>
              <h3 id="commoon-words">Common words</h3>
              <p>
                By the time someone is 5 or 6 years old, they’ll use 2,500 to
                5,000 common words.
              </p>
              <p>
                Adults still find these words easier to recognise and understand
                than words they’ve learned since.
              </p>
              <p>
                By age 9, people have built up a ‘common words’ vocabulary of
                around 15,000 words (divided between a set of 5,000 primary and
                10,000 secondary words) which they use every day.
              </p>
              <h3 id="reading-skills">Reading skills</h3>
              <p>
                People quickly learn to read the 6,000 common words (the primary
                set that they use most). They then stop reading these words and
                start recognising their shape allowing them to read much faster.
              </p>
              <p>
                This means people do not read one word at a time and bounce

                in.

                People’s brains can actually drop up to 30% of the text in front
                of them and still understand what they’re reading.
              </p>
              <p>
                This means people do not need to read every word to understand
                what is written.

              <p>
                People read very differently online than they do on paper. They
                do not necessarily read top to bottom or even from word to word.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead, they only read around 25% of web pages and, where they
                just want to complete a task as quickly as possible, they read
                even less out of impatience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Research has consistently shown that people tend to read pages

                across when they find what they need.

                This means, if we use the right words and put the most important
                first and in the right places - we can create good content for

              <h3 id="using-the-inverted-pyramid-style">
                Using the inverted pyramid style
              </h3>
              <p>
                Writing in what is known as an ‘inverted pyramid style’ will
                help focus your content on your essential message.
              </p>
              <p>
                The inverted pyramid refers to the concept of creating content
                in order of its importance to the reader rather than in the
                traditional narrative structure (see figure below).
              </p>
              <p>
                If you can answer the following questions about the subject of
                your content within the first few paragraphs then it should
                leave with the kind of content which meets your users’ needs and
                requirements:
              </p>
              <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Who?</li>
                <li>What?</li>
                <li>When?</li>
                <li>Where?</li>
                <li>Why?</li>
                <li>How?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This should result in the conclusion of the main facts about
                your content appearing foremost within your content with other
                lesser points included in descending order of importance as you
                continue to create your content.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this way it mimics the way users use web content and is
                widely viewed as the best practice style of content creation
                (see figure below).
              </p>
              <img
                src={imageInvertedPyramid}
                className="govuk-!-width-three-quarters"
                alt=""
              />
              <p>
                You can carry out something called the ‘Two Sentence Test to see
                how successful you have been in meeting these requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                You’ll know if you’ve been successful if you can read the first
                2 sentences of your content and take away the information you
                think your user needs and requires from your content.
              </p>
              <h3 id="do-not-duplicate-content">Do not duplicate content</h3>
              <p>
                Do not repeat content which already exists. If the content
                you’re looking to create has already been written elsewhere then
                simply link to it instead.
              </p>
              <p>
                This will cut down your word count and is something that you can
                readily do with the service as it’s no longer confined by the
                flatter structure of the existing PDF format.
              </p>
              <h3 id="avoid-redundant-introductory-words">
                Avoid redundant introductory words
              </h3>
              <p>
                These do not tend to give the user any more information than
                what they would already assume from reading the title of your
                content and finding it in the first place.
              </p>
              <p>For example:</p>
              <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>This set of statistics is about…</li>
                <li>The purpose of this document is…</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Instead, just tell users what they need to know and it will cut
                down your word count to and help you create clear and concise
                content.
              </p>
              <h3 id="plan-organise-and-question-your-content">
                Plan, organise and question your content
              </h3>
              <p>
                Break up and group your content into different topics and
                organise them under common headings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then list the questions you think users will ask about each
                topic and put them in an order you think will make sense to your
                users.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, bearing in mind that most users are usually
                impatient - put the question you think they’ll ask the most at
                the top.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alternatively, you could organise them in line with a process
                that your users might need to follow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Write answers to all the questions you’ve written down and then
                remove all the questions and see if what’s left flows logically.
              </p>
              <p>If not, reorder and tweak your answers until they do.</p>
              <p>
                Alternatively, finding answers to the following questions will
                help identify any gaps and make your content more user-friendly:
              </p>
              <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Is this really what I want to say?</li>
                <li>
                  Does the information flow from the crucial to helpful and then
                  on to nice to know?
                </li>
                <li>Can I say it more clearly and concisely?</li>
                <li>Do I need to add or cut anything to make it clearer?</li>
                <li>Does it have the right tone and flow?</li>
                <li>Do I need to add any subheadings?</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="write-your-content-alongside-someone-else">
                Write your content alongside someone else
              </h3>
              <p>
                Consider writing your content alongside a colleague, in front of
                the same computer or on a piece of paper.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is commonly called ‘pair writing’ and you can pair up with
                anyone as it works along the lines that 2 brains work better
                than 1.
              </p>
              <p>
                Try not to work together for more than 2 hours at a time and
                find a quiet place where you can work together without
                interruption so you can get the most out of your time together.
              </p>
              <h3 id="organise-a-peer-review">Organise a peer review </h3>
              <p>
                A peer review is an opportunity for other people to comment on
                your content.
              </p>
              <p>
                It usually means getting a team of people to meet to discuss
                your content while one person takes notes.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's not easy to let other people tell you what’s wrong with
                your content so make sure you come up with some clear rules so
                you can receive some meaningful feedback.
              </p>
              <p>The 2 main rules should be something along the lines of:</p>
              <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>
                  be respectful - everyone did the best job possible with the

                </li>
                <li>
                  leave your ego at the door - it's not about you...it's about
                  communicating clearly so users can understand your statistics
                  and data
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Come up with a list of simple questions to help promote
                discussion. For example:
              </p>
              <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>
                  Do the headline messages tell the story in a clear and
                  non-technical way?
                </li>
                <li>Is the language used non-technical and accessible?</li>
                <li>
                  Are the statistics placed in the context of the real world?
                </li>
                <li>Does the title clearly describe what is in the release?</li>
                <li>Are the analysis and conclusions valid?</li>
                <li>
                  Is interpretation included that is impartial and evidence
                  based?
                </li>
                <li>Is it made clear why the statistics are produced?</li>
                <li>Does it have extra words, missing words or typos?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Don't get into arguments about what you like or someone else
                likes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead, concentrate on whether an idea has been written to the
                standards set out in our content design guide and style guide.

                them grab and go
              </p>
              <p>
                In many cases, web sites are replacing phones. In many cases,
                the point of web content is for people to get information for
                themselves from your web site rather than having them call or
                talk to someone.
              </p>
              <p>
                So write like you would explain it to someone in a conversation
                or via a presentation and with the authority of someone who can
                actively help.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can check if you’ve been successful by simply reading your
                content out loud.
              </p>
              <p>
                Good content should also have a good rhythm and actually sound
                natural and good when it's spoken.
              </p>
              <p>
                So reading what you've written out loud is a good way to find
                out if your sentences are short enough and words clear enough.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you hesitate, stumble or have to take too many breaths when
                reading out a sentence then you’ll know something is not quite
                right.
