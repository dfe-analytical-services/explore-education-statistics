  This "readyToRenderChildren" flag controls whether this component is ready to render its children
  or not. This will be set to true only when this component has established
  that it is dealing with one of the following cases:

  1) No logged-in user at all (i.e. a user with no tokens in local storage),
  in which case the unauthenticated user can view pages that are visible to
  unauthenticated users and any children of this AuthContext that use
  "useAuth()" will be provided with a null "user". Any attempt to view a
  component within a ProtectedRoute after this will be redirected to the
  login page (by the ProtectedRoute itself).

  2) An authenticated user (i.e. a user with tokens in local storage) who has
  returned from a successful post-login redirect from the Identity Provider,
  has logged in or registered successfully with our local login /
  registration endpoint, and who has been redirected to the desired
  post-IdP-login page (as provided by the response from the Identity Provider
  if one was requested).

  3) An authenticated user (i.e. a user with tokens in local storage) who has
  loaded the SPA but not via a post-login redirect from the Identity
  Provider, and has logged in or registered successfully with our local login
  / registration endpoint. At this point, this flag is set to true, the user
  remains on the current route and will see the current page.

  4) An authenticated user (i.e. a user with tokens in local storage) who is
  unable to request a valid access token (generally as a result of the local
  access token expiring and the refresh token also expiring), and so is
  redirected to the login page, at which point this flag is set to true so
  that they can see the login page successfully.

  5) An authenticated user (i.e. a user with tokens in local storage) who is
  unable to successfully call the local login / registration endpoint, by not
  having a local user record and having either no invites or only expired
  invites. At this point they will be redirected to either the "No Invites"
  page or the "Expired Invites" page, and this flag will be set to true so
  that they can successfully see the page. */
