<h3 id="permanent-exclusion">Permanent exclusion</h3>

<p>When a pupil is not allowed to attend (or is excluded from) a school and cannot go back to that specific school unless their exclusion is overturned.</p>

<h3 id="persistent-absence">Persistent absence</h3>

<p>When a pupil misses (or is absent from) 10% or more possible school sessions.</p>

<p>Counted in sessions, where 1 session is equivalent to half-a-day.</p>

<p>This definition changed at the start of the 2015/16 academic year.</p>

<p>For further information on this change read our <a href="/methodology/pupil-absence-in-schools-in-england">Pupil absence statistics: methodology</a> guidance.</p>

<h3 id="possible-school-session">Possible school session</h3>

<p>Schools are required to provide 2 possible sessions per day - 1 session in the morning and 1 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>This is why a session is equivalent to half-a-day.</p>

<h3 id="pupil-enrolment">Pupil enrolment</h3>

<p>A way to refer to a 'pupil' at a school. The number of pupil enrolments presented includes pupils on the school roll for at least 1 session who are aged between 5 and 15 years, excluding boarders. </p>

<p>Some pupils may be counted more than once. For example, if they moved schools during the academic year or are registered in more than 1 school.</p>

<h3 id="pupil-referral-unit">Pupil referral unit (PRUs)</h3>

<p>An alternative education provision specifically organised to provide education for children who are not able to attend school and may not otherwise receive a suitable education.</p>

<p>This could be because they have a short- or long-term illness, have been excluded from school or are a new starter waiting for a mainstream school place.</p>

<p>Under section 19 of the Education Act 1996, each local education authority (LEA) has a duty to provide suitable education for children of compulsory school age who cannot attend school.</p>

<p>Placing pupils in PRUs is one of the ways in which LEAs can make sure they can comply with this duty.</p>

<p>PRUs are a mixture of public units and privately managed companies.</p>

<h3 id="pupils-with-1-or-more-fixed-period-exclusion">Pupils with one or more fixed-period exclusion</h3>

<p>Pupil who have had at least one fixed-period exclusion across a full academic year.</p>
