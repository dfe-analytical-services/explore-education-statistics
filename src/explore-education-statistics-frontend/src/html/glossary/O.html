<h3 id="otherwise-vulnerable">Otherwise vulnerable</h3>
  
<p>Children and young people might be identified as ‘otherwise vulnerable’, falling in to the category of vulnerable children and young people, if education providers or local authorities (including children’s social care services) identify them as such. These groups of students could therefore benefit from continued full-time attendance during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
  
<p>Examples of why a student might be identified as otherwise vulnerable include:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>children and young people on the edge of receiving support from children’s social care services or in the process of being referred to children’s services</li>
  <li>adopted children or children on a special guardianship order</li>
  <li>those at risk of becoming NEET (‘not in employment, education or training’)</li>
  <li>those living in temporary accommodation</li>
  <li>those who are young carers</li>
  <li>those who may have difficulty engaging with remote education at home (for example due to a lack of devices or quiet space to study)</li>
  <li>care leavers</li>
  <li>others at the provider and local authority’s discretion including pupils and students who need to attend to receive support or manage risks to their mental health</li>
  <li>those who may have difficulty engaging with remote education at home (for example, due to a lack of devices or quiet space to study)</li>
</ul>
