This project was bootstrapped with [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Setup

1. A `.env` file is included by default with required values needed to run the frontend project locally. You can create a `.env.local` file to change environment variables without commiting these changes to the repository.


## Data API and Content API

If running the app in development mode, you will need to run these APIs locally.

This can be done by running the following from the 'root' directory:

```bash
pnpm start data content
```

## Available Scripts

See the root [README](../../README.md) for available scripts
