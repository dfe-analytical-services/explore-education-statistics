For example, through illness.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Unauthorised absence is absence without permission from the school.

Methodology\",\"Caption\":\"\",\"Content\":[{\"Body\":\"<h3 id=\\\"section3-1\\\">3.1 Collection and cleaning of the data</h3>\\n<p>\\n  Secondary and primary data were gathered from local authorities (LAs) at pupil\\n  level, with a record for each applicant for a school place.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  This data has been aggregated by DfE into the local authority level figures\\n  provided in this release.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The data collected is the position as at the respective national offer day. It\\n  includes all offers made on that day, regardless of whether they were\\n  subsequently accepted or refused.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Cleaning of the data prior to aggregation may cause slight differences between\\n  the figures contained in this publication and any released by the LAs\\n  themselves closer to the respective national offer days.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  In some cases an application was recorded by both the home authority (to whom\\n  the application was made) and also by the LA within which the school where a\\n  place was offered is based.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  To be correct, only the home authority to whom the applicant sent their form\\n  should record the application and offer. Therefore the duplicate record\\n  submitted by the LA in which the school is based has been removed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Applications listing preferences or offers to schools which could not be\\n  identified from the school census,\\n  <!-- -->\\n  <a href=\\\"https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/\\\"\\n    >Get Information About Schools</a\\n  >\\n  <!-- -->or via one of the additional 'dummy' school codes used to identify new\\n  schools or split entries (see below) were removed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Other very small adjustments have been made as required to the source data to\\n  ensure that we provide as full and accurate a picture of the application and\\n  offer process as possible (for example, removing the second example if two\\n  offers have been recorded for one applicant, causing double-counting).\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"section3-2\\\">3.2 Interpretation of the figures</h3>\\n<p>\\n  The figures are based on the offers sent out by LAs on the respective national\\n  offer days.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The final numbers of pupils starting in specific schools is likely to be\\n  different due to late applicants, refusal of offers, subsequent offers made\\n  via a second offer round or via the schools' waiting lists, or successful\\n  appeals. Revised figures incorporating any subsequent changes are not\\n  collected or published.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The inclusion of a school by an applicant as one of their preferences does not\\n  mean that they meet the admissions criteria for that school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Examples of where the applicant has little or no chance of being admitted on\\n  national offer day include naming a selective school having not passed the\\n  grammar entrance test, living a long way out of catchment for a popular\\n  community school and requesting a place for a boy at a girls' school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Some schools offer places via a lottery, where everyone who applies has an\\n  equal (subject to fair banding) chance of being considered, which may\\n  encourage applications.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  If an authority is not able to make an offer of a preferred school, in most\\n  cases they offer a place at an alternative school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, some authorities chose instead to send the applicant a list of\\n  schools with available places and invite them to state which of these schools\\n  they would prefer their child to attend. These incidences are recorded as the\\n  applicant receiving no offer.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  A total of five LAs made no alternative offers on secondary national offer\\n  day, to applicants to whom they were not able to make an offer of one of their\\n  preferred schools, and six made no alternative offers on primary national\\n  offer day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The tables include the percentage of offers which are of schools a) within or\\n  b) outside the LA to which the application was made. These are calculated as a\\n  proportion of all offers, including those made to non-applicants (see table\\n  notes).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The LAs were asked not to provide data on school places offered to children\\n  with an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHC) or statement of special\\n  educational needs (SEN), since the parents of these children were not required\\n  to apply for a school place.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, there are a number of applications where special schools were amongst\\n  the preferences stated and, in some cases, a special school has been offered.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  It's assumed these are offers to SEN children who do not have a statement or\\n  EHCP. These preferences and offers have been included in the final figures.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  At secondary level the application is for the main entry point into secondary\\n  school in that local authority. This is usually year 7 but a small number of\\n  authorities have a main entry point in year 9 and this is what they report on.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  For LAs with more than one entry point, the intake with the largest number of\\n  places available is the one reported.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Places at schools such as UTCs and studio schools, whose intake is in year 10\\n  (at age 14 years) are not allocated via the co-ordinated admissions process\\n  and therefore are not included in these figures.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Some schools have two entry routes. At primary school this is generally a\\n  school with a single school code but with two sites, each of which can be\\n  applied for separately.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  At secondary level the two routes are usually either a school with day and\\n  boarding places, or a school with a number of places reserved for those\\n  passing aptitude tests (for example, in music or languages).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  In these cases, parents can apply for both routes (e.g. for both sites of a\\n  split-site primary school), so a 'dummy' school code is used to identify the\\n  second option for each affected school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  All mainstream state-funded schools, including academies, are included in the\\n  figures.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, new opener free schools can have a rapid set-up process and may not\\n  be ready in time to make their offers within the local authority co-ordinated\\n  exercise.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Therefore, for their first year of operation only, free schools may make\\n  offers directly and those that do so will be excluded from these figures. In\\n  their second year of operation, they must make offers within the local\\n  authority co-ordination process.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The Isles of Scilly local authority has one school which takes pupils between\\n  the ages of 3 and 16.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Parents are not required to complete an application form and there is no\\n  competition for a place at the school. Therefore this authority has been\\n  omitted from both tables as preference rates cannot be calculated.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"section3-3\\\">3.3 Further information</h3>\\n<p>\\n  This release is the latest in an annual series with releases from 2011 onwards\\n  available on<!-- -->\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-school-applications\\\"\\n    >Statistics: school applications</a\\n  >statistics website.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, information on primary level preferences is only included from 2014\\n  onwards.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  This is when DfE started collecting data on primary applications and offers,\\n  based on the newly introduced national primary offer day of 16 April (or next\\n  working day).\\n</p>\\n\",\"Type\":\"HtmlBlock\",\"Id\":\"a89226ef-1d6a-48ba-a795-0dbc334a9198\",\"Order\":0,\"Comments\":null}],\"Release\":null},{\"Id\":\"f129939b-803f-461b-8838-e7a3d8c6eca2\",\"Order\":4,\"Heading\":\"4.

For\\n  lunchtime exclusions, each lunchtime for which the exclusion applies counts as\\n  one session.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Exclusion only covers the number of sessions the pupil is expected to be at\\n  the school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  A fixed-period exclusion can be discontinuous which means there can be days\\n  between the start and finish dates of the exclusion that are not included as\\n  part of the exclusion.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Where a pupil is dually registered, exclusion sessions are not recorded for\\n  the days when they would have been attending the other establishment.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  For example, a pupil is excluded for six sessions starting on a Monday.\\n  However, the pupil is registered with another provider on the Wednesday from\\n  which they have not been excluded.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Therefore, the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Monday,\\n  Tuesday and Thursday. The pupil's attendance on the Wednesday would be\\n  recorded separately by the other provider.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Exclusions sessions are not recorded for the days when the pupil is attending\\n  an approved educational activity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  For example, a year 10 pupil has been excluded for six sessions starting on a\\n  Wednesday. However, the pupil attends work experience on a Thursday from which\\n  they're not excluded.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The pupil in this situation would be excluded from the school for sessions on\\n  Wednesday, Friday and Monday.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Days on which there's a planned school closure do not count towards an\\n  exclusion.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  For example, a pupil has been excluded from a school for four sessions\\n  starting on a Friday but the school is planned to be closed on the Monday for\\n  an INSET day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Therefore the pupil's exclusion should include the two sessions on the\\n  following Tuesday, rather than the Monday.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"section4-4-5\\\">4.4.5 In care and SEN indicators</h4>\\n<p>\\n  For each exclusion, the pupil's in care status and SEN provision at the time\\n  of exclusion is recorded.

They also include information for [pupil referral units](../glossary#pupil-referral-unit) and pupils aged 4 years.

We use the key measures of [overall absence](../glossary#overall-absence) and [persistent absence](../glossary#persistent-absence) to monitor pupil absence and also include [absence by reason](#contents-sections-heading-4) and [pupil characteristics](#contents-sections-heading-6).

The statistics and data are available at national, regional, local authority (LA) and school level and are used by LAs and schools to compare their local absence rates to regional and national averages for different pupil groups.

They're also used for policy development as key indicators in behaviour and school attendance policy.

Within this release, absence by reason is broken down in three different ways:

* distribution of absence by reason - the proportion of absence for each reason, calculated by taking the number of absences for a specific reason as a percentage of the total number of absences

* rate of absence by reason - the rate of absence for each reason, calculated by taking the number of absences for a specific reason as a percentage of the total number of possible sessions

* one or more sessions missed due to each reason - the number of pupils missing at least 1 session due to each reason"

**Authorised absence**

The [authorised absence](../glossary#authorised-absence) rate has stayed at 3.4% since 2015/16 but has been decreasing in recent years within primary schools.

The total number of days missed for [overall absence](../glossary#overall-absence) across state-funded primary, secondary and special schools has increased to 56.7 million from 54.8 million in 2015/16.

While the overall absence rate has slightly increased since 2015/16 the illness rate has stayed the same at 2.6%.

The absence rate due to other unauthorised circumstances has also stayed the same since 2015/16 at 0.7%.

**Absence due to family holiday**

The unauthorised holiday absence rate has increased gradually since 2006/07 while authorised holiday absence rates are much lower than in 2006/07 and remained steady over recent years.

The percentage of pupils who missed at least 1 session due to family holiday increased to 16.9% - up from 14.7% in 2015/16.

The absence rate due to family holidays agreed by the school stayed at 0.1%.

Meanwhile, the percentage of all possible sessions missed due to unauthorised family holidays increased to 0.4% - up from 0.3% in 2015/16.

**Regulation amendment**

A regulation amendment in September 2013 stated that term-time leave could only be granted in exceptional circumstances which explains the sharp fall in authorised holiday absence between 2012/13 and 2013/14.

These statistics and data relate to the period after the [Isle of Wight Council v Jon Platt High Court judgment (May 2016)](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/insights/term-time-holidays-supreme-court-judgment/) where the High Court supported a local magistrates’ ruling that there was no case to answer.

They also partially relate to the period after the April 2017 Supreme Court judgment where it unanimously agreed that no children should be taken out of school without good reason and clarified that 'regularly' means 'in accordance with the rules prescribed by the school'."
