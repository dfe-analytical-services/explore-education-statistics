This continues the increase in secondary applications seen since 2013 which came on the back of a rise in births which began in the previous decade.

Since 2013, when secondary applications were at their lowest, there has been a 16.6% increase in the number of applications.

**Secondary offers**

The proportion of secondary applicants receiving an offer of their first-choice school has decreased to 82.1% - down from 83.5% in 2017.

The proportion of applicants who received an offer of any of their preferred schools also decreased slightly to 95.5% - down from 96.1% in 2017.

**Secondary National Offer Day**

These statistics come from the process undertaken by local authorities (LAs) which enabled them to send out offers of secondary school places to all applicants on the [Secondary National Offer Day](/glossary#national-offer-day) of 1 March 2018.

The secondary figures have been collected since 2008 and can be viewed as a time series in the following table.");

While the overall absence rate has slightly increased since 2015/16 the illness rate has stayed the same at 2.6%.

The absence rate due to other unauthorised circumstances has also stayed the same since 2015/16 at 0.7%.

**Absence due to family holiday**

The unauthorised holiday absence rate has increased gradually since 2006/07 while authorised holiday absence rates are much lower than in 2006/07 and remained steady over recent years.

The percentage of pupils who missed at least 1 session due to family holiday increased to 16.9% - up from 14.7% in 2015/16.

The absence rate due to family holidays agreed by the school stayed at 0.1%.

Meanwhile, the percentage of all possible sessions missed due to unauthorised family holidays increased to 0.4% - up from 0.3% in 2015/16.

**Regulation amendment**

A regulation amendment in September 2013 stated that term-time leave could only be granted in exceptional circumstances which explains the sharp fall in authorised holiday absence between 2012/13 and 2013/14.

These statistics and data relate to the period after the [Isle of Wight Council v Jon Platt High Court judgment (May 2016)](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/insights/term-time-holidays-supreme-court-judgment/) where the High Court supported a local magistrates’ ruling that there was no case to answer.

They also partially relate to the period after the April 2017 Supreme Court judgment where it unanimously agreed that no children should be taken out of school without good reason and clarified that 'regularly' means 'in accordance with the rules prescribed by the school'.");

The total number of days missed for [overall absence](/glossary#overall-absence) across state-funded primary, secondary and special schools has increased to 56.7 million from 54.8 million in 2015/16.

The following most common reasons saw the largest increases:

* physical assault against a pupil

* persistent disruptive behaviour

* other reasons

**Persistent disruptive behaviour**

Remained the most common reason for permanent exclusions accounting for 2,755 (35.7%) of all permanent exclusions - which is equivalent to 3 permanent exclusions per 10,000 pupils.

However, in special schools the most common reason for exclusion was physical assault against an adult - accounting for 37.8% of all permanent exclusions and 28.1% of all [fixed-period exclusions](../glossary#fixed-period-exclusion).

Persistent disruptive behaviour is also the most common reason for fixed-period exclusions accounting for 108,640 of all fixed-period exclusions - up from 27.7% in 2015/16. This is equivalent to around 135 fixed-period exclusions per 10,000 pupils.

All reasons saw an increase in fixed-period exclusions since 2015/16. Persistent disruptive behaviour and other reasons saw the largest increases.");

* national curriculum years 9 and 10

* pupils with special educational needs (SEN)

* pupils known to be eligible for and claiming free school meals (FSM)

**Age, national curriculum year group and gender**

* more than half of all [permanent exclusions](../glossary#permanent-exclusion) (57.2%) and [fixed-period exclusions](../glossary#fixed-period-exclusion) (52.6 %) occur in national curriculum year 9 or above

* a quarter (25%) of all permanent exclusions were for pupils aged 14 - who also had the highest rates for fixed-period exclusion and pupils receiving [one or more fixed-period exclusion](../glossary#one-or-more-fixed-period-exclusion)

* the permanent exclusion rate for boys (0.15%) was more than 3 times higher than for girls (0.04%)

* the fixed-period exclusion rate for boys (6.91%) was almost 3 times higher than for girls (2.53%)

**Pupils eligible for and claiming free school meals (FSM)**

* had a permanent exclusion rate of 0.28% and fixed period exclusion rate of 12.54% - around 4 times higher than those not eligible for FSM at 0.07% and 3.50% respectively

* accounted for 40% of all permanent exclusions and 36.7% of all fixed-period exclusions

**Special educational needs (SEN) pupils**

* accounted for around half of all permanent exclusions (46.7%) and fixed-period exclusions (44.9%)

* had the highest permanent exclusion rate (0.35%0 - 6 times higher than the rate for pupils with no SEN (0.06%)

* pupils with a statement of SEN or education, health and care (EHC) plan had the highest fixed-period exclusion rate at 15.93% - more than 5 times higher than pupils with no SEN (3.06%)

**Ethnic group**

* pupils of Gypsy/Roma and Traveller of Irish Heritage ethnic groups had the highest rates of permanent and fixed-period exclusions - but as the population is relatively small these figures should be treated with some caution

* pupils from a Black Caribbean background had a permanent exclusion rate nearly 3 times higher (0.28%) than the school population as a whole (0.10%)

* pupils of Asian ethnic groups had the lowest permanent and fixed-period exclusion rates");
