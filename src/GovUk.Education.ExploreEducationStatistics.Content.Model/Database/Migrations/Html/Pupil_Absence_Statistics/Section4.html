<h3 id="section4-1">4.1 The collection process: 2005/06 to present</h3>
<p>
  The school census collects information for a pupil’s absence in the term prior
  to the census - ie one term in arrears.
</p>
<p>
  For example, the spring school census collects information on absence during
  the autumn term.
</p>
<p>
  Data is collected one term in arrears to ensure all absences are accounted for
  and recorded in each term.
</p>
<p>
  Within the autumn census all schools are required to provide the first and
  second halves of the summer term’s absence figures separately.
</p>
<p>
  This allows total absence levels to be calculated for both the full year and
  the first five half terms. For further information:<!-- -->

<p>

  it was first collected in 1993/94. A timeline is also available in<!-- -->

</p>
<h4 id="section4-2-1">4.2.1 School census - 2005/06 to present</h4>
<p>
  In <strong>spring 2006</strong> the school census started to collect enrolment
  level absence data on a termly basis (spring, summer and autumn collections)
  from maintained secondary schools, city technology colleges and academies
  relating to absence in the 2005/06 academic year.<!-- -->
</p>
<p>
  In the <strong>spring 2007</strong> school census the scope of the collection
  was extended to maintained primary schools, collecting absence data for the
  2006/07 academic year.
</p>
<p>
  Reason for absence was also collected for the first time in the<!-- -->
  <strong>spring 2007</strong> school census, collecting absence by reason data
  for the autumn term 2006.<!-- -->
</p>
<p>
  Prior to the 2016/17 academic year special schools did not provide termly
  absence data - instead they provided annual enrolment level absence returns.
</p>
<p>
  Special school absence information was collected for the first time in the
  <strong>autumn 2007</strong> school census, collecting absence data for the
  2006/07 academic year.
</p>
<p>
  From <strong>September 2011</strong> data collection systems were amended so
  that the national attendance code “D” (dual registered) was no longer counted
  in the school census as an attendance or a possible session.
</p>
<p>
  Following this, schools should only record the pupil’s attendance and absence
  for those sessions that a pupil was scheduled to attend at that school and the
  code “D” attendance code should be used to signify a session attended via the
  dual school.
</p>
<p>
  This means that any dual registered pupils attending full time at their dual
  school (school B) for the period would have zero possible sessions recorded
  for school A.<!-- -->
</p>
<p>
  Absence data for four year olds was collected for the first time in the spring
  2013 school census, collecting absence information for the autumn term 2012.<!-- -->
</p>
<p>
  Absence data for the second half of the summer term (the sixth half term) was
  collected by DfE for the first time in the autumn 2013 school census.
</p>
<p>
  Previously absence data had only been collected for autumn term, spring term
  and the first half of the summer term.
</p>
<p>
  An amended persistent absentee threshold for the full year was also introduced
  to account for the additional half term of absence
</p>
<p>
  Whilst six half term data is more indicative of the academic year and
  therefore became the main measure for overall absence from this point, five
  half term data is still published alongside six half term data up to and
  including the 2013/14 academic year (until a meaningful time series for six
  half term data is established).
</p>
<p>
  Table 7 provides a comparison of absence figures based on five half terms and
  six half terms, for the full 2012/13 academic year, when data for the sixth
  half term was first included.

  In spring 2014, the scope of the collection was extended again to collect
  termly pupil referral unit (PRU) absence information relating to absence in
  the 2013/14 academic year.
</p>
<p>
  Previously absence data for PRUs had been collected annually via the PRU
  census, where the absence information related to the previous academic year.
  This census has now been amalgamated into the school census.
</p>
<p>
  Pupil-level PRU absence information was collected from all PRUs via the PRU
  census for 2009/10 to 2011/12. However, no absence information for the 2012/13
  academic year was collected for PRUs due to the move from PRU census to school
  census.
</p>
<p>
  As of the spring 2014 school census, code 'F' (authorised absence due to
  agreed extended family holiday) was discontinued following an amendment to the
  Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006.

<h4 id="section4-2-4">4.2.2 Absence in schools survey: 1993/94 to 2004/05</h4>
<p>
  Prior to 2005/06, DfE's main source of absence data was the absence in schools
  survey which was conducted in May each year and collected (at school level)
  the number of day pupils of compulsory school age together with information on
  the number of sessions missed due to authorised and unauthorised absence.
</p>
<p>
  Absence information was collected from maintained primary, secondary, all
  special and independent schools, city technology colleges and academies in
  England.<!-- -->

<p>
  Data covering the 2005/06 academic year from both sources shows that the

  Schools with a statutory low age of below 7 and a statutory high age of above
  14 years have been flagged as all-through schools in pupil absence National

  Absence information for 2005/06 was the first years’ worth of absence data

  year of collection, information was collected for secondary schools only.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-3-3">4.3.3 Coverage - 1993/94 to 2004/05</h4>
<p>
  The absence in schools survey collected annual absence data (at school level)

<h3 id="section4-4">4.4 What absence information is collected</h3>
<p>
  Schools are expected to supply the following via their school census returns:
</p>
<h4 id="section4-4-1">4.4.1 The number of sessions possible</h4>
<p>
  Schools must record the number of sessions possible for each enrolment for the
  attendance period (term or half term). There are two sessions for each school
  day (morning and afternoon).<!-- -->
</p>
<p>
  Every pupil aged 4 to 15 years (excluding boarders) as at the start of the
  academic year (31 August) who was on the school roll for at least one session
  during the specified attendance period should have an entry for the number of
  possible sessions.
</p>
<p>
  Enrolments with zero possible sessions are not included in the Department’s
  absence releases.
</p>
<p>Special cases when recording possible sessions:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>dual registered pupils</strong> - to avoid the double counting
      absence for pupils who are registered at more than one school (referred to
      as 'dual registered'). Each school should:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        only record the attendance and absence for the sessions the pupil is
        required to attend at their school<!-- -->
      </li>
      <li>
        use code 'D' (dual registered at another educational establishment) to
        record all of the sessions the pupil is due to attend at the other
        school
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>zero sessions possible</strong> - can be recorded where a dual
      registered pupil has spent all of the attendance period (term or half
      term) at their other school.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if a dual-registered pupil spent all of the term/ half term
      at his/her subsidiary registration then the main registration would have
      zero sessions possible recorded for that term in the census.<!-- -->

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>summer half term</strong> - the official school leaving date for a
      pupil who ceases to be of compulsory school age is the last Friday in June
      of the academic year following the pupil’s fifteenth birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that year 11 pupils must remain on the school roll until this
      date and their attendance must be recorded.<!-- -->

      Schools remain responsible for year 11 pupils up to the leaving date, even

      <strong>pupils aged four</strong> - these pupils are not of compulsory
      school age and their absence information is collected for indicative
      purposes only.
    </p>
    <p>
      DfE collects this data because good patterns of regular and punctual
      attendance can be set from the early years and schools will want to be
      aware of their performance in this respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of sessions they're expected to attend will vary from pupil to
      pupil and from school to school.

    <p>
      Attendance code 'X' (non-compulsory school age absence - not counted in
      possible attendances) should be used for those sessions when a four year
      old is not expected to attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within National Statistics, four year old absences are presented
      separately to those for pupils of compulsory school age and only overall
      absence rates are published.

<h4>Authorised absence reasons</h4>
<p>Only special circumstances should warrant an authorised leave of absence.</p>
<p>
  Schools should consider each application individually and take into account
  the specific circumstances and relevant background context behind the request
  before authorising.<!-- -->
</p>
<p>
  The authorised reasons schools can use to record absences via the school
  census are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>illness (not medical or dental appointments)</strong> - schools
      should advise parents to notify them on the first day the child is unable
      to attend due to illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schools should authorise absences due to illness unless they have genuine
      cause for concern about the veracity of an illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the authenticity of illness is in doubt, schools can request parents to
      provide medical evidence to support illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schools can record the absence as unauthorised if not satisfied of the
      authenticity of the illness but should advise parents of their intention.
      Schools are advised not to request medical evidence unnecessarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medical evidence can take the form of prescriptions, appointment cards etc
      rather than doctors’ notes.
      <!-- -->
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>medical or dental appointments</strong> - missing registration for
      a medical or dental appointment is counted as an authorised absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, schools should encourage parents to make appointments out of
      school hours. Where this is not possible, the pupil should only be out of
      school for the minimum amount of time necessary for the appointment.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>holiday authorised by the school</strong> - Headteachers should
      not grant leave of absence unless there are exceptional circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application must be made in advance and the headteacher must be
      satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances based on the individual
      facts and circumstances of the case which warrant the leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where a leave of absence is granted, the headteacher will determine the
      number of days a pupil can be away from school. A leave of absence is
      granted entirely at the headteacher’s discretion.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>religious observance</strong> - schools must treat absence as
      authorised when it is due to religious observance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day must be exclusively set apart for religious observance by the
      religious body to which the parents belong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where necessary, schools should seek advice from the parents’ religious
      body about whether it has set the day apart for religious observance.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>study leave</strong> - schools must record study leave as
      authorised absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Study leave should be used sparingly and only granted to year 11 pupils
      during public examinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Provision should still be made available for those pupils who want to
      continue to come into school to revise.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Gypsy, Roma and Traveller absence</strong> - a number of different
      groups are covered by the generic term Traveller – Roma, English and Welsh
      Gypsies, Irish and Scottish Travellers, Showmen (fairground people) and
      Circus people, Bargees (occupational boat dwellers) and New Travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This code should be used when Traveller families are known to be
      travelling for occupational purposes and have agreed this with the school
      but it's not known whether the pupil is attending educational provision.
      It should not be used for any other types of absence by these groups.<!-- -->
    </p>
    <p>
      To help ensure continuity of education for Traveller children it's
      expected that the child should attend school elsewhere when their family
      is travelling and be dual registered at that school and the main school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children from these groups whose families do not travel are expected to
      register at a school and attend as normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      They're subject to the same rules as other children in terms of the
      requirement to attend school regularly once registered at a school.<!-- -->
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>excluded but no alternative provision made</strong> - if no
      alternative provision is made for a pupil to continue their education
      whilst they are excluded but still on the admission register, they should
      be marked absent in the attendance register using code 'E'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternative provision must be arranged for each excluded pupil from the
      sixth consecutive day of any fixed-period or permanent exclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where alternative provision is made they should be marked using the
      appropriate attendance code.
      <!-- -->
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>other authorised absences</strong> - any authorised absences not
      covered by the groups above.
    </p>
    <p>This code should only be used in exceptional circumstances.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Unable to attend due to exceptional circumstances</h4>
<p>
  In 2012, for the 2011/12 academic year, the school census started to collect
  absence information for pupils who are unable to attend school due to
  exceptional circumstances, or attendance code 'Y'
</p>
<p>
  Absences due to exceptional circumstances do not count as a possible session
  and are not included in National Statistics.
</p>
<p>This code can be used where a pupil is unable to attend because:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the school site (or part of it) is closed due to an unavoidable cause</li>
  <li>
    transport provided by the school or a local authority is not available and
    where the pupil’s home is not within walking distance
  </li>
  <li>
    a local or national emergency has resulted in widespread disruption to
    travel which has prevented the pupil from attending school
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This code can also be used where a pupil is unable to attend because:<!-- -->
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <p>
      the pupil is in custody - detained for a period of less than four months.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the school has evidence from the place of custody that the pupil is
      attending educational activities then they can record those sessions as
      code 'B' (present at approved educational activity).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section4-4-5">4.4.5 Absence by reason for four year olds</h4>
<p>
  Schools are not obliged to use individual absence and attendance codes for
  pupils aged four.
</p>
<p>
  However, theyre encouraged to use these codes and (if they do so) the
  appropriate absences will be returned in the school census.
</p>
<p>
  If schools do not wish to use these codes then the total number of absences
  for the attendance period will be recorded as sessions missed due to
  authorised absence.<!-- -->
</p>
<p>
  Absences recorded for four year olds will not be treated as 'authorised' or
  'unauthorised' and will instead be reported and published as overall absence
  only.<!-- -->
</p>
<h3 id="section4-5">4.5 No longer collected but available historically</h3>
<p>
  The authorised absence code 'extended family holiday' was discontinued as of
  September 2014 and should not be used by schools.
</p>
<p>
  As of the<!-- -->

  >
  <!-- -->Statistical First Release (SFR), any extended family holiday absence
  returned will be combined with 'authorised family holiday' absence.
</p>
<p>
  Separate absence figures for 'extended family holiday' are published
  historically.
</p>
<p>
  For 2009/10 to 2011/12, absence information for pupils attending pupil
  referral units (PRUs) was collected annually via the PRU census and published
  as an additional table to the full year absence release in May each year.
</p>
<p>
  As of January 2014 PRU census information, including absence data, is now
  collected termly via the school census and published as an additional table to
  each termly SFR.
</p>
<p>
  For the 2012/13 academic year, due to the move from PRU census to school
  census, absence data was not collected from PRUs.
</p>
<h3 id="section4-6">4.6 What absence information is not collected</h3>
<p>DfE does not collect the following information:</p>
<h4 id="section4-6-1">4.6.1 Boarding school absence</h4>
<p>
  Boarding schools without day-pupils are not required to keep an attendance
  register.
</p>
<p>
  Schools with a mixture of day-pupils and boarders must keep an attendance
  register for the day-pupils but absence information will not be collected for
  boarders.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-6-2">4.6.2 Closed school absence</h4>
<p>
  Data are collected a term in arrears. This means, where a school closes, data
  are not collected for the last term the school was open.
</p>
<p>
  For schools which close at the end of a term, data for that term will not be
  collected.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-6-3">4.6.3 Internal absence</h4>
<p>
  DfE is unable to identify 'internal absence'. This is defined as any absence
  by pupils between the school’s twice-daily registrations - ie a pupil is
  recorded as attending during morning or afternoon registration but is
  physically not present at another part of the relevant session.
</p>
<p>
  DfE’s current data systems are limited to only record and measure the
  registrations required by law - not any subsequent absence.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-6-4">4.6.4 Those not registered at a school</h4>
<p>
  DfE only collects absence data for pupils on roll of a state-funded primary,
  state-funded secondary, special schools or pupil referral units (including
  alternative provision academies) during the absence period.
</p>
<p>
  It does not include those children who are not registered at a school.<!-- -->
</p>
<h4 id="section4-6-5">4.6.5 Daily absence and periods of absence</h4>
<p>
  Absence information is collected termly for primary and secondary schools and
  pupil referral units (PRUs) and is collected annually for special schools.
</p>
<p>
  DfE does not collect dates of absence and is therefore unable to provide
  absence figures for specific days, weeks or months.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, DfE is unable to identify the lengths of individual absences as
  only aggregated absence totals (either overall or broken down by reason) are
  collected for each enrolment.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-6-6">
  4.6.6 Individual reason absence - for example, chronic illness or snow days
</h4>
<p>
  DfE collects pupil absence information broken down by reason. However, these
  groupings are broad and often cover a range of potential reasons grouped under
  one relevant category.
</p>
<p>
  Breakdowns often requested by users are absences due to specific types of
  illness or days lost due to snow or flooding - both of which we're unable to
  provide individually.
</p>
<p>
  Specific illnesses would be covered under the 'illness' reason for 33 absence
  and sessions missed due to snow or flooding would be covered under the
  'exceptional circumstances' reason for absence, or attendance code 'Y'.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-6-7">4.6.7 Post-16 and nursery pupil’s absence</h4>
<p>
  Absence information is collected and published for pupils of compulsory school
  age (aged between five and fifteen years) as of the start of the academic year
  (31 August).
</p>
<p>
  Absence information for four year olds is also collected for indicative
  purposes only.
</p>
<p>
  DfE does not report on absence for pupils aged three years and below or aged
  sixteen years and above and schools should not provide this data. Therefore
  such breakdowns are unavailable.
</p>
<h4 id="section4-6-8">4.6.8 Pupil attendance</h4>
<p>
  DfE collects pupil absence information only - attendance codes are not
  collected.<!-- -->
</p>
<p>Attendance codes used by schools:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>present at school</strong> - pupils must not be marked present if
      they were not in school during registration.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a pupil were to leave the school premises after registration they would
      still be counted as present for statistical purposes.<!-- -->
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>late arrival before the register has closed</strong> - schools
      should have a policy on how long registers should be kept open; this
      should be for a reasonable length of time but not that registers are to be
      kept open for the whole session.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pupil arriving after the register has closed should be marked absent
      with code 'U' or with another absence code if it's more appropriate.<!-- -->
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Attendance codes for when pupils are present at an approved off-site
  educational activity:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>off-site educational activity</strong> - should be used when
      pupils are present at an off-site educational activity that has been
      approved by the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately schools are responsible for the safeguarding and welfare of
      pupils educated off-site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore by using code B, schools are certifying that the education is
      supervised and measures have been taken to safeguard pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      This code should not be used for any unsupervised educational activity or
      where a pupil is at home doing school work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schools should ensure they have in place arrangements whereby the provider
      of the alternative activity notifies the school of any absences by
      individual pupils.

    <p>
      <!-- -->The school should record the pupil’s absence using the relevant
      absence code.

  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>consortia schools</strong> - pupils attending consortia schools as
      part of their course only need to be placed on the registers of their
      'main' school rather than on all of the schools they attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      They should be treated as guest pupils at the other consortia schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, consortia schools must ensure they have suitable systems in place
      for monitoring and reporting the attendance and absence of the pupils
      involved, which must be shared with the 'main' school.

      the session in question because they were scheduled to attend the other
      school at which they are registered.<!-- -->
    </p>
    <p>
      The main examples of dual registration are pupils who are attending a

    <p>
      It can also be used when the pupil is known to be registered at another

    <p>
      Schools must put pupils on the admission register from the first day that

      school.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>planned whole or partial school closure</strong> - should be used
      for whole or partial school closures that are known or planned in advance
      such as between terms, half terms, occasional days (for example, bank
      holidays), weekends (where it's required by the management information
      system), up to five non-educational days to be used for curriculum
      planning/training; and use of schools as polling stations.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>different term dates for different pupils</strong> - schools and

    <p>
      A code '#' can be used to record the year groups that are not due to

      attending on that day are still offered a full education over the school
      year.
