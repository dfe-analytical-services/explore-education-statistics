The unauthorised holiday absence rate has increased gradually since 2006/07 while authorised holiday absence rates are much lower than in 2006/07 and remained steady over recent years.

Meanwhile, the percentage of all possible sessions missed due to unauthorised family holidays increased to 0.4% - up from 0.3% in 2015/16.

**Regulation amendment**

A regulation amendment in September 2013 stated that term-time leave could only be granted in exceptional circumstances which explains the sharp fall in authorised holiday absence between 2012/13 and 2013/14.

These statistics and data relate to the period after the [Isle of Wight Council v Jon Platt High Court judgment (May 2016)](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/insights/term-time-holidays-supreme-court-judgment/) where the High Court supported a local magistrates’ ruling that there was no case to answer.

They also partially relate to the period after the April 2017 Supreme Court judgment where it unanimously agreed that no children should be taken out of school without good reason and clarified that 'regularly' means 'in accordance with the rules prescribed by the school'."

   * Bedford - 96.4%

   Northumberland has been the top performer in this measure since 2015.

   As in previous years, the lowest first preference rates were all in London.

   * Hammersmith and Fulham - 51.4%

   * Kensington and Chelsea - 54.3%

   * Lambeth - 55.2%

   These figures do not include City of London which has a tiny number of applications and no secondary schools.

   Hammersmith and Fulham has had the lowest first preference rate since 2015.

   The higher number of practical options available to London applicants and ability to name 6 preferences may encourage parents to make more speculative choices for their top preferences.

   **Regional variation**

   There's much less regional variation in the proportions receiving any preferred offer compared to those for receiving a first preference as shown in the following chart."

**Secondary offers**

In 2018, 91.6% of secondary offers made were from schools inside the home authority. This figure has been stable for the past few years.

This release concentrates on the headline figures for the proportion of children receiving their first preference or a preferred offer.

However, the main tables provide more information including:

* the number of places available

* the proportion of children for whom a preferred offer was not received

* whether applicants were provided with offers inside or outside their home authority"

The number of applications received for primary school places decreased to 608,180 - down 2% on 2017 (620,330).

This is the result of a notable fall in births since 2013 which is now feeding into primary school applications.

The number of primary applications is the lowest seen since 2013 - when this data was first collected.

**Primary offers**

The proportion of primary applicants receiving an offer of their first-choice school has increased to 91% - up from 90% in 2017.

The proportion of applicants who received an offer of any of their offer of any of their preferences has also increased slightly to 98.1% - up from 97.7% in 2017.

**Primary National Offer Day**

These statistics come from the process undertaken by local authorities (LAs) which enabled them to send out offers of primary school places to all applicants on the Primary National Offer Day of 16 April 2018.

The primary figures have been collected and published since 2014 and can be viewed as a time series in the following table."

At local authority (LA) level, the 3 highest first preference rates were achieved by the following local authorities:

* East Riding of Yorkshire - 97.6%

* Northumberland - 97.4%

* Rutland - 97.4%

These authorities are in the top 3 for the first time since 2015.

The lowest first preference rates were all in London.

* Kensington and Chelsea - 68.4%

* Camden - 76.5%

* Hammersmith and Fulham - 76.6%

Hammersmith and Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea have both been in the bottom 3 since 2015.

Although overall results are better at primary level than at secondary, for London as a whole the improvement is much more marked:

* secondary first preference rate decreased to 66% - down from 68.% in 2017"
