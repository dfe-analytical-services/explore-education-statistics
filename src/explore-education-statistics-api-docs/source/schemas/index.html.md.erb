# API Schemas

This section lists all the schemas available on the explore education statistics API.

A schema specifies the data structure of a request or response used in the API. Schemas are
typically composed of a set of properties and some information about each of these, including:

- the property name
- the property type e.g. string, number, boolean, array, object, etc
- if it is required or optional
- a description of the property
- any validation rules that apply

Examples of each schema are provided to give a flavour of how the schema will look in practice.
Note that examples **may not** accurately reflect a true request / response from the API.
