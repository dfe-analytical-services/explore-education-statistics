# How to get CSV data

In this guide, you'll learn how to get CSV data from the explore education statistics (EES) API.
This may be particularly useful if you wish to access data sets in their entirety, or find it more
comfortable to work with CSVs.

## What you'll need

You should already be familiar with the EES API. If not, you should read the [Quick start](/getting-started/quick-start/index.html)
first as this guide will presume some prior knowledge.

To run request examples in this guide, it is a good idea to come prepared with a HTTP or API client
tool. Good recommendations for beginners are [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

Some prior knowledge of working with your chosen HTTP client will be necessary to work with the
examples.

## Get an entire data set as a CSV file

Every data set is created from an underlying CSV file that contains  **all** the data. You may find
it useful (or necessary) to work with the underlying CSV instead of interacting with the data set
via the API.

The underlying CSV file can be downloaded via the [Download data set CSV](/endpoints/DownloadDataSetCsv/index.html)
endpoint. To use this endpoint, you need to make a `GET` request:

```
GET <%= api_url "/api/v1/data-sets/{dataSetId}/csv" %>
```

In the request URL, you'd substitute the `{dataSetId}` parameter with your chosen data set's ID.

Upon making this request, a download containing the CSV data should start. The file will
be gzip compressed (like most of the API responses), meaning that your HTTP client will need to
support gzip decompression to extract the contents.

It should be noted that the CSV data will be use human-readable labels for its contents instead of
machine-readable identifiers. This means that unlike the rest of the API, there are no backward
compatibility guarantees between different versions of the data set.
