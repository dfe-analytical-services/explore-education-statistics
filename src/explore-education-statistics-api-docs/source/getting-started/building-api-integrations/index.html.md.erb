# Building API integrations

To support building integrations on top of the explore education statistics API, software development
kits (SDKs) are provided to streamline common tasks and communication with the API.

We are keen to hear from users who are interested in having more dedicated support for their
chosen language or software. If you have any ideas, questions or would like to work with us to
develop support for your chosen language or software, [contact us via email](/support/index.html).

## Available SDKs

- for R users - [eesyapi R package](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/eesyapi.R)
- for PowerBI users - [eesyapi.powerbi](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/eesyapi.powerbi)

We have plans for a Python library as well, [get in touch with us](/support/index.html) if you'd be interested in this.
