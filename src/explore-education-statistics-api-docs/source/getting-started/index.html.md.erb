# Getting started

The explore education statistics (EES) API provides a way to directly consume published data from
the EES service using HTTP.

Note that to provide a consistent, reliable structure, not all data sets available in EES are accessible via the API. For a full list of data sets
published by EES, visit the [Data catalogue](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/data-catalogue)
on the main website. If there are any data sets you would like to see added to the API, please 
[contact our explore education statistics team](/support/index.html) or the specific contact details 
of the publisher of the data you are interested in.


To get started with the EES API, you'll need either:

- an API client such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
  if you are exploring the API
- an HTTP client in the programming language of your choice if you are developing on top of the API

The documentation on this website will assume a level of familiarity with how HTTP, web APIs and
REST work. You should research these topics prior to using the EES API if you are not familiar with
them.

It is recommended that you start with the [Quick start guide](/getting-started/quick-start/index.html)
if you are new to the EES API. This will guide you through essential parts of the API and the workflow to
perform a basic data set query.

The [Overview](/overview/index.html) section is a good next step for a more in-depth understanding
of the high level parts of the EES API.

To assist in specific tasks once you've started using the EES API, there are additional guides under
**Getting started** in the navigation menu that you may find useful.

## Documentation structure

The [Overview section](/overview/index.html) provides high level documentation about the EES API.
This details things such as message formats, error handling, versioning and the OpenAPI specification.

The [Endpoints section](/reference-v1/endpoints/index.html) provides reference documentation about the endpoints
available in the API. This details the requests that can be made and their responses. Code samples are
also provided to illustrate how requests could be made.

The [Schemas section](/reference-v1/schemas/index.html) provides reference documentation about the structure of
all the requests and responses (i.e. their schemas) across the API. Each schema provides in-depth
detail about their properties, including their type and validation rules.

The [building API integrations page](/getting-started/building-api-integrations/index.html) provides
information about software development kits (SDKs) that have been created to streamline common tasks and
communication with the API, including software specific guidance for R, PowerBI and Python.
