# Error handling

The explore education statistics (EES) API uses conventional HTTP status codes and response bodies to
present errors from the API.

Typically, 2xx status codes indicate a success, 4xx status codes indicate an error with the request
itself (e.g. there were validation errors), and 5xx status codes indicate an error that occurred
within the API itself.

The HTTP status codes that you can typically expect from the API are summarised by the following table:

| Status code | Name              | Description                                                                                                                    |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200         | OK                | Success. The API should provide a successful response.                                                                         |
| 204         | No Content        | Success. The request succeeded, but there was no content in the response.                                                      |
| 400         | Bad Request       | There were issues (e.g. validation errors) with the request meaning it could not be processed.                                 |
| 401         | Unauthorized      | The request lacks valid authentication credentials and was denied access.                                                      |
| 403         | Forbidden         | The request has authentication credentials, but was denied access to the requested resource.                                   |
| 404         | Not Found         | The requested resource could not be found.                                                                                     |
| 429         | Too Many Requests | There were too many requests in a short amount of time. Avoid making further requests, or use an appropriate backoff strategy. |
| 504         | Gateway Timeout   | The request took too long and exceeded the maximum allowed time.                                                               |

## The error response body

If an error occurs, the EES API will respond with a body that looks like the following:

```json
{
  "title": "There was a problem processing the request.",
  "type": "Internal Server Error",
  "status": 500
}
```

The response body is modelled by the [ProblemDetailsViewModel](/schemas/ProblemDetailsViewModel/index.html)
schema, which attempts to detail the reason(s) why the request failed. The following fields are always
included:

| Property | Type   | Description                                                    |
|----------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `title`  | string | The title of the error. Typically summarises the error.        |
| `type`   | string | The error type. Usually corresponds with the HTTP status code. |
| `status` | number | The HTTP status code.                                          |

## Handling validation errors

The API validates requests to ensure that the inputs make sense before they are processed. Issues
can be things like:

- missing parameters
- values that are not allowed
- values that are malformed or not formatted correctly

If there are validation errors with the request, the API will respond with a body that looks like
the following:

```json
{
  "title": "There are validation errors with the request.",
  "type": "Bad Request",
  "status": 400,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Error message",
      "code": "ErrorCode",
      "path": "someField"
    }
  ]
}
```

This response contains the validation errors in the `errors` property. Every validation error will
at least contain a `message` property describing the specific problem to address.

Errors will also typically contain a `code` property. These can be useful for diagnosing issues
further, or for simply parsing errors with consuming code.

If the error relates to a specific part of the request, the `path` property is used to describe the
path to request property that caused the error. If this is omitted or empty, it means the error is
'global' and relates to the entire request.

Where possible, errors may also contain a `detail` property to provide further exact
details about the problem. These do not have a specific structure, but may look something like:

```json
{
  "message": "Must be one of the allowed values.",
  "code": "AllowedValue",
  "path": "someField",
  "detail": {
    "items": [25, 30]
  }
}
```

In the above validation error, the `detail` indicates that only the numbers 25 and 30 are values
that can be used for the `someField` request property.

### Global errors

If a validation error relates to the request as a whole, there will no specific request parameter
that it relates to.

These types of validation errors are considered 'global' and the `path` will be unset or empty. This
looks like the following:

```json
{
  "title": "There are validation errors with the request.",
  "type": "Bad Request",
  "status": 400,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "A global error message",
      "code": "GlobalErrorCode"
    }
   ]
}
```

### Deeply nested parameters

A validation response may also report errors relating to deeply nested parameters in the request.
It does this by describing a path to the specific parameter using JSONPath notation, for example:


```json
{
  "title": "There are validation errors with the request.",
  "type": "Bad Request",
  "status": 400,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Error message",
      "code": "ErrorCode",
      "path": "some.nested[1].thing"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the above example, the error would relate to a deeply nested property of a request body that
looks like the following:

```json
{
  "some": {
    "nested": [
      { "thing": "a" },
      { "thing": "b" }
    ]
  }
}
```

The error would relate to the second item in the `nested` array. For that item it would specifically
relate to its `thing` property i.e. the value `"b"`.

Using the above request structure, validation errors are possible for all the following paths:

- `some`
- `some.nested`
- `some.nested[0]`
- `some.nested[0].thing`
- `some.nested[1]`
- `some.nested[1].thing`
