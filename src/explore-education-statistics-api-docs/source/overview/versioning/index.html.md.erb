# Versioning

The Explore Education Statistics (EES) API uses URL-based versioning. Each endpoint encodes its current
version within its URL e.g. `/api/v1/the-endpoint`, `/api/v2/the-endpoint`, etc.

When backwards-incompatible changes to an endpoint are unavoidable, a new version of the endpoint
will be published. Backwards-incompatible changes may include things like:

- removing properties in the request or response schema
- changing the structure of the request or response schema
- changing validation rules for the request

In the event that a new endpoint version is necessary, the previous version(s) of the endpoint will
be maintained for as long as possible. This should provide sufficient opportunity to migrate to the
new endpoint version.

For new major API versions, guidance on migrating your existing code will be published in the
changelog documentation for the API.

## Data set versioning

Data sets available through this API may introduce changes over time. Similar to other types of
versioning, major or minor versions will be published as required.

The following are considered **major** (breaking) changes:

- facets (filters, geographic levels, locations, time periods) were deleted
- indicators were deleted

The following are considered **minor** changes:

- facets were added
- facet options were added
- facet details were updated (e.g. label, hint)
- facet options were updated (e.g. label)
- indicators were added
- indicator details were updated (e.g. label, unit, decimal places)
- data values were updated

As long as you have specified a data set version to use, any query that you have previously created
should continue to work as normal regardless of new versions being published.

### Upgrading to newer versions

When you wish to upgrade a query to use a newer data set version, it's important to check the
changes introduced by the version and consider if they affect your consuming code.

You can find lists of changes via:

- the data set's changelog on its details page on the EES website (see [Data catalogue](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/data-catalogue))
- the [Get a data set version's changes](/endpoints/GetDataSetVersionChanges/index.html) endpoint
