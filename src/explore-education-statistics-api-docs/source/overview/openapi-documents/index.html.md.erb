# OpenAPI documents

The explore education statistics (EES) API is fully compliant with the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://swagger.io/specification/v3/).

The OpenAPI specification provides a standard language for documenting REST APIs and their capabilities.
Using a document that conforms to this specification, users can understand how to use an API and navigate
through it with minimal effort.

OpenAPI documents for the EES API can be downloaded below:

<% get_openapi_links.each do |link| %>
- <%= link_to "#{link[:name]} document", link[:url] %>
<% end %>

With an OpenAPI document, you can do things like:

- explore it with a third-party HTTP client tool such as Postman or Insomnia
- generate an API client for writing integrations
- run automated tests against it to validate your integrations
