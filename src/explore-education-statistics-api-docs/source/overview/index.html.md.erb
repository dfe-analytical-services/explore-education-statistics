# Overview

The explore education statistics (EES) API adheres to REST principles. It uses standard HTTP verbs,
JSON encoding in message bodies and provides HTTP status codes for different response types.

The API primarily provides access to data sets published by EES, allowing you to:

- get summary information about data sets and their related resources
- query data sets based on specific criteria
- download the underlying CSV files of data sets

Note that not all data sets available in EES are accessible via the API. For a full list of data sets
published by EES, visit the [Data catalogue](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/data-catalogue)
on the main website.
