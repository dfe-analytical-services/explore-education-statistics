For example, through illness.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Unauthorised absence is absence without permission from the school. This\\n  includes all unexplained or unjustified absences and arrivals after\\n  registration has closed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  For further information:<!-- -->\\n  <a href=\\\"#section3-1\\\">3.1 Overall absence methodology</a>.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Persistent absence is when a pupil enrolment’s overall absence equates to 10%\\n  or more of their possible sessions.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  For further information:<!-- -->\\n  <a href=\\\"#section3-2\\\">3.2 Persistent absence methodology</a>.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"section1-5\\\">1.5 Cohort used in absence measures</h3>\\n<p>\\n  Absence information is collected and disseminated at enrolment level rather\\n  than pupil level.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  This means where a pupil has moved school throughout the year, theyll be\\n  counted more than once as they have recorded attendance and absence at more\\n  than one school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  This allows for schools to be held accountable for pupil absences, as the\\n  absence is attached to enrolments at a particular school, not the individual\\n  pupil.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  All the enrolments at a school over the period in question are included in the\\n  absence measures, not just the pupils on roll at a particular date.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Schools only record absence for the period a pupil is on roll at their school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The number of pupil enrolments is approximately 4% higher than the number of\\n  pupils.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"section1-6\\\">1.6 The school year (five half terms vs six half terms)</h3>\\n<p>\\n  Generally, the academic year is made up of three terms - autumn, spring and\\n  summer.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Each term has two parts (half-terms) which are usually separated by a half\\n  term break.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Since the 2012/13 academic year, pupil absence information has been collected\\n  for the full academic year (ie all six half terms).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, prior to this absence information was collected for the first five\\n  half terms only, meaning absences in the second half of the summer term were\\n  not collected.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Since the 2012/13 academic year, DfE's key absence indicators have been based\\n  on the full academic year’s (ie six half terms) data.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, as we're unable to rework time series tables or provide any\\n  historical six half term absence levels DfE continued to publish a full set of\\n  absence information for the first five half terms up to and including the\\n  2013/14 academic year.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Following this, a single csv file based on data for five half terms has been\\n  published alongside the annual absence publications so longer term-time\\n  comparisons can still be made.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  To account for high levels of study leave and other authorised absences for\\n  pupils aged 15 in the second half of the summer term, all possible sessions\\n  and absences relating to this period for 15 year olds (as at the start of the\\n  academic year) are removed prior to any analysis being undertaken and are not\\n  included in any published statistics.\\n</p>\\n<table class=\\\"govuk-table\\\">\\n  <caption class=\\\"govuk-table__caption\\\">\\n    Table 1: State-funded primary, secondary and special schools -

Methodology\",\"Caption\":\"\",\"Content\":[{\"Type\":\"HtmlBlock\",\"Body\":\"<h3 id=\\\"section3-1\\\">3.1 Collection and cleaning of the data</h3>\\n<p>\\n  Secondary and primary data were gathered from local authorities (LAs) at pupil\\n  level, with a record for each applicant for a school place.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  This data has been aggregated by DfE into the local authority level figures\\n  provided in this release.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The data collected is the position as at the respective national offer day. It\\n  includes all offers made on that day, regardless of whether they were\\n  subsequently accepted or refused.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Cleaning of the data prior to aggregation may cause slight differences between\\n  the figures contained in this publication and any released by the LAs\\n  themselves closer to the respective national offer days.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  In some cases an application was recorded by both the home authority (to whom\\n  the application was made) and also by the LA within which the school where a\\n  place was offered is based.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  To be correct, only the home authority to whom the applicant sent their form\\n  should record the application and offer. Therefore the duplicate record\\n  submitted by the LA in which the school is based has been removed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Applications listing preferences or offers to schools which could not be\\n  identified from the school census,\\n  <!-- -->\\n  <a href=\\\"https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/\\\"\\n    >Get Information About Schools</a\\n  >\\n  <!-- -->or via one of the additional 'dummy' school codes used to identify new\\n  schools or split entries (see below) were removed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Other very small adjustments have been made as required to the source data to\\n  ensure that we provide as full and accurate a picture of the application and\\n  offer process as possible (for example, removing the second example if two\\n  offers have been recorded for one applicant, causing double-counting).\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"section3-2\\\">3.2 Interpretation of the figures</h3>\\n<p>\\n  The figures are based on the offers sent out by LAs on the respective national\\n  offer days.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The final numbers of pupils starting in specific schools is likely to be\\n  different due to late applicants, refusal of offers, subsequent offers made\\n  via a second offer round or via the schools' waiting lists, or successful\\n  appeals. Revised figures incorporating any subsequent changes are not\\n  collected or published.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The inclusion of a school by an applicant as one of their preferences does not\\n  mean that they meet the admissions criteria for that school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Examples of where the applicant has little or no chance of being admitted on\\n  national offer day include naming a selective school having not passed the\\n  grammar entrance test, living a long way out of catchment for a popular\\n  community school and requesting a place for a boy at a girls' school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Some schools offer places via a lottery, where everyone who applies has an\\n  equal (subject to fair banding) chance of being considered, which may\\n  encourage applications.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  If an authority is not able to make an offer of a preferred school, in most\\n  cases they offer a place at an alternative school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, some authorities chose instead to send the applicant a list of\\n  schools with available places and invite them to state which of these schools\\n  they would prefer their child to attend. These incidences are recorded as the\\n  applicant receiving no offer.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  A total of five LAs made no alternative offers on secondary national offer\\n  day, to applicants to whom they were not able to make an offer of one of their\\n  preferred schools, and six made no alternative offers on primary national\\n  offer day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The tables include the percentage of offers which are of schools a) within or\\n  b) outside the LA to which the application was made. These are calculated as a\\n  proportion of all offers, including those made to non-applicants (see table\\n  notes).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The LAs were asked not to provide data on school places offered to children\\n  with an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHC) or statement of special\\n  educational needs (SEN), since the parents of these children were not required\\n  to apply for a school place.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, there are a number of applications where special schools were amongst\\n  the preferences stated and, in some cases, a special school has been offered.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  It's assumed these are offers to SEN children who do not have a statement or\\n  EHCP. These preferences and offers have been included in the final figures.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  At secondary level the application is for the main entry point into secondary\\n  school in that local authority. This is usually year 7 but a small number of\\n  authorities have a main entry point in year 9 and this is what they report on.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  For LAs with more than one entry point, the intake with the largest number of\\n  places available is the one reported.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Places at schools such as UTCs and studio schools, whose intake is in year 10\\n  (at age 14 years) are not allocated via the co-ordinated admissions process\\n  and therefore are not included in these figures.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Some schools have two entry routes. At primary school this is generally a\\n  school with a single school code but with two sites, each of which can be\\n  applied for separately.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  At secondary level the two routes are usually either a school with day and\\n  boarding places, or a school with a number of places reserved for those\\n  passing aptitude tests (for example, in music or languages).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  In these cases, parents can apply for both routes (e.g. for both sites of a\\n  split-site primary school), so a 'dummy' school code is used to identify the\\n  second option for each affected school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  All mainstream state-funded schools, including academies, are included in the\\n  figures.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, new opener free schools can have a rapid set-up process and may not\\n  be ready in time to make their offers within the local authority co-ordinated\\n  exercise.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Therefore, for their first year of operation only, free schools may make\\n  offers directly and those that do so will be excluded from these figures. In\\n  their second year of operation, they must make offers within the local\\n  authority co-ordination process.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The Isles of Scilly local authority has one school which takes pupils between\\n  the ages of 3 and 16.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Parents are not required to complete an application form and there is no\\n  competition for a place at the school. Therefore this authority has been\\n  omitted from both tables as preference rates cannot be calculated.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"section3-3\\\">3.3 Further information</h3>\\n<p>\\n  This release is the latest in an annual series with releases from 2011 onwards\\n  available on<!-- -->\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-school-applications\\\"\\n    >Statistics: school applications</a\\n  >statistics website.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, information on primary level preferences is only included from 2014\\n  onwards.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  This is when DfE started collecting data on primary applications and offers,\\n  based on the newly introduced national primary offer day of 16 April (or next\\n  working day).\\n</p>\\n\"}]},{\"Order\":4,\"Heading\":\"4.
