It\\n  includes all offers made on that day, regardless of whether they were\\n  subsequently accepted or refused.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Cleaning of the data prior to aggregation may cause slight differences between\\n  the figures contained in this publication and any released by the LAs\\n  themselves closer to the respective national offer days.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  In some cases an application was recorded by both the home authority (to whom\\n  the application was made) and also by the LA within which the school where a\\n  place was offered is based.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  To be correct, only the home authority to whom the applicant sent their form\\n  should record the application and offer. Therefore the duplicate record\\n  submitted by the LA in which the school is based has been removed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Applications listing preferences or offers to schools which could not be\\n  identified from the school census,\\n  <!-- -->\\n  <a href=\\\"https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/\\\"\\n    >Get Information About Schools</a\\n  >\\n  <!-- -->or via one of the additional 'dummy' school codes used to identify new\\n  schools or split entries (see below) were removed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Other very small adjustments have been made as required to the source data to\\n  ensure that we provide as full and accurate a picture of the application and\\n  offer process as possible (for example, removing the second example if two\\n  offers have been recorded for one applicant, causing double-counting).\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"section3-2\\\">3.2 Interpretation of the figures</h3>\\n<p>\\n  The figures are based on the offers sent out by LAs on the respective national\\n  offer days.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The final numbers of pupils starting in specific schools is likely to be\\n  different due to late applicants, refusal of offers, subsequent offers made\\n  via a second offer round or via the schools' waiting lists, or successful\\n  appeals. Revised figures incorporating any subsequent changes are not\\n  collected or published.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The inclusion of a school by an applicant as one of their preferences does not\\n  mean that they meet the admissions criteria for that school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Examples of where the applicant has little or no chance of being admitted on\\n  national offer day include naming a selective school having not passed the\\n  grammar entrance test, living a long way out of catchment for a popular\\n  community school and requesting a place for a boy at a girls' school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Some schools offer places via a lottery, where everyone who applies has an\\n  equal (subject to fair banding) chance of being considered, which may\\n  encourage applications.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  If an authority is not able to make an offer of a preferred school, in most\\n  cases they offer a place at an alternative school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, some authorities chose instead to send the applicant a list of\\n  schools with available places and invite them to state which of these schools\\n  they would prefer their child to attend. These incidences are recorded as the\\n  applicant receiving no offer.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  A total of five LAs made no alternative offers on secondary national offer\\n  day, to applicants to whom they were not able to make an offer of one of their\\n  preferred schools, and six made no alternative offers on primary national\\n  offer day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The tables include the percentage of offers which are of schools a) within or\\n  b) outside the LA to which the application was made. These are calculated as a\\n  proportion of all offers, including those made to non-applicants (see table\\n  notes).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The LAs were asked not to provide data on school places offered to children\\n  with an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHC) or statement of special\\n  educational needs (SEN), since the parents of these children were not required\\n  to apply for a school place.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, there are a number of applications where special schools were amongst\\n  the preferences stated and, in some cases, a special school has been offered.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  It's assumed these are offers to SEN children who do not have a statement or\\n  EHCP. These preferences and offers have been included in the final figures.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  At secondary level the application is for the main entry point into secondary\\n  school in that local authority. This is usually year 7 but a small number of\\n  authorities have a main entry point in year 9 and this is what they report on.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  For LAs with more than one entry point, the intake with the largest number of\\n  places available is the one reported.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Places at schools such as UTCs and studio schools, whose intake is in year 10\\n  (at age 14 years) are not allocated via the co-ordinated admissions process\\n  and therefore are not included in these figures.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Some schools have two entry routes. At primary school this is generally a\\n  school with a single school code but with two sites, each of which can be\\n  applied for separately.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  At secondary level the two routes are usually either a school with day and\\n  boarding places, or a school with a number of places reserved for those\\n  passing aptitude tests (for example, in music or languages).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  In these cases, parents can apply for both routes (e.g. for both sites of a\\n  split-site primary school), so a 'dummy' school code is used to identify the\\n  second option for each affected school.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  All mainstream state-funded schools, including academies, are included in the\\n  figures.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, new opener free schools can have a rapid set-up process and may not\\n  be ready in time to make their offers within the local authority co-ordinated\\n  exercise.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Therefore, for their first year of operation only, free schools may make\\n  offers directly and those that do so will be excluded from these figures. In\\n  their second year of operation, they must make offers within the local\\n  authority co-ordination process.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The Isles of Scilly local authority has one school which takes pupils between\\n  the ages of 3 and 16.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Parents are not required to complete an application form and there is no\\n  competition for a place at the school. Therefore this authority has been\\n  omitted from both tables as preference rates cannot be calculated.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"section3-3\\\">3.3 Further information</h3>\\n<p>\\n  This release is the latest in an annual series with releases from 2011 onwards\\n  available on<!-- -->\\n  <a\\n    href=\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-school-applications\\\"\\n    >Statistics: school applications</a\\n  >statistics website.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  However, information on primary level preferences is only included from 2014\\n  onwards.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  This is when DfE started collecting data on primary applications and offers,\\n  based on the newly introduced national primary offer day of 16 April (or next\\n  working day).\\n</p>\\n\"}]},{\"Order\":4,\"Heading\":\"4.

In other circumstances a panel\\n  can recommend, rather than direct, that a governing body reconsiders its\\n  decision.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  No additional payment is required if reinstatement is not offered following a\\n  recommendation to reconsider.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Whether or not a school recognises that a pupil has special educational needs\\n  (SEN), all parents (or pupils if aged 18 or over) have the right to request\\n  the presence of a SEN expert at an independent review panel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The SEN expert's role is to provide impartial advice to the panel about how\\n  SEN could be relevant to the exclusion.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  For example, whether the school acted reasonably in relation to its SEN duties\\n  when excluding the pupil.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The data does not show whether any reinstatement offer has been accepted by\\n  parents.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"section3-3-1\\\">\\n  3.3.2 Appeals against permanent exclusions: prior to 2012/13\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n  Prior to 1 September 2012, independent appeal panels were used to appeal the\\n  decision to permanently exclude a pupil.
